# Movie Recommendation App

This is a movie recommendation application where users can select a genre or enter specific criteria (e.g., release year, rating) to get a list of recommended movies.

Used a movie API from [themoviedb.org](https://developer.themoviedb.org/) to fetch movie data based on the user's preferences. Practice working with async/await to handle the asynchronous fetching of movie information.
